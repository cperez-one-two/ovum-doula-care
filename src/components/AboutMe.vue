      <p>Hi, Iâ€™m Cali! I am a Certified Birth and Postpartum Doula and Midwife Assistant in training currently located in Philadelphia, PA. My passion for birth stems from the belief that birth is a physiological experience that deserves education, respect, and support. The pillars of my practice are bodily autonomy, body literacy, and educated consent within the birth space.</p>

    <div class="px-6 pt-6 md:col-start-1 md:col-span-2">
      <p class="pb-4">I became a trained Birth Doula through Bini Birth in 2018 and hold a certification through PALs Doulas in Seattle WA. I also hold a postpartum doula certification through ProDoula. Additionally I am trained in the Fertility Awareness Method of fertility tracking and have a 200 hour yoga teacher certification allowing me to support families with healthy movement during pregnancy. With a background in childcare, I see myself as a nurturer and enjoy inspiring empowerment in families through providing information, continuity of care, and support of their individual desires around their birth and parenting experience.</p>
      <p class="pb-4">I am thrilled to be a part of your pregnancy and birth journey.</p>
