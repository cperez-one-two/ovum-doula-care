        <p class="pb-4">It is proven that people give birth the best when they feel safe. Whether this means a hospital birth, pain relieving drugs, a home birth, a natural birth, birth center etc, I am here to support you towards obtaining the birth that you envision, adapt to the unpredictable nature of childbirth and feel as safe as possible.</p>
        <p class="pb-4">As a birth and postpartum doula, my mission is to walk alongside the birthing person throughout the entire process of pregnancy, labor, and new life with an infant providing physical, emotional and educational support every step of the way. I believe that birth is a normal physiological event that deserves consent, continuous support, and respect.</p>
        <p class="pb-4">As I engage with your individual hopes and fears surrounding your birth experience, I will keep my personal views on birth aside and aid to create an environment of educated consent about the options for delivery and parenting. I vow to consistently educate myself on social justice issues related to birth and to continue to question how I can serve birthing people better.</p>
        <p class="pb-4">When you enter the postpartum period, I will be there to meet your family's needs and provide educational support on the ins and outs of newborn care, breastfeeding, physical recovery and more. </p>
        <p class="pb-4">I intend to grow my business and community, creating a network of support for my clients. I vow to hold the process of birth and postpartum with respect for the vulnerable, intimate event that it is with confidentiality and communication.</p>
